## Background
In 2004, Samsung needed to understand the characteristics of Chinese TV broadcasting and general TV functions before introducing its first generation Digital TV into the Chinese market. The most important signal resource in China was the satellite signal, and then cable signal and over-the-air broadcast; generally the number of channels was over 50. In China one content provider may provide several channels (e.g. over 10 channels for Beijing TV Station). The Channel number is not fixed with content providers; users can adjust the number to any channel they like. The program schedule is quite flexible. For example, a program can start at 8:33 and end at 9:05. Captions were not widely implemented in China and the keys on remote control were rarely color-coded.

(Note: this was the pre-digital TV era in China.)
