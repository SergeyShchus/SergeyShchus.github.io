excerpt: >-
  Human-Robot peer-based teams are evolving from a far-off possibility into a
  reality. Human Performance Moderator Functions (HPMFs) can be used to predict
  human behavior by incorporating the effects of internal and external
  influences such as fatigue and workload. This research focuses on determining
  the applicability of workload HPMFs in team tasks for first response mass
  casualty triage incidents between a Human-Human and a Human-Robot team.

## Background
This study's goal is to evaluate the applicability of existing human performance moderator functions (HPMFs) to human performance in peer-based human-robot teams. HPMFs are equations derived from empirical data to predict human performance due to specific performance factors, such as fatigue, mental workload or temperature. Interaction between humans and robots in peer-based teams can be dramatically affected by human performance. Our research is focused on determining if existing human performance moderator functions for task workload apply to peer-based human-robot interaction and if not, how such functions must be modified.

## Method
The evaluation involved the validation of a series of human performance models, created using the Army Research Lab's IMPRINT Pro Software. The models depict multiple team-based scenarios involving first responders (both robot and human) to disaster events. The performance models provide a prediction of the HPMFs (e.g., workload) according to current HPMFs and this prediction is evaluated with real people and robots in test scenarios.

During the evaluation, two different conditions were studied. First, human-only teams completed the scenarios where one individual in the team will be an evaluator and the other human will be the participant. The participant and the evaluator will partner to complete the task. The evaluator gave the participant instructions on assessing victims' injuries (triage) based on the information reported by the participant. Second, a human participant was paired with a robot, both of whom were supervised remotely by a human evaluator. The robot and the participant partnered to complete the victim assessments. Performance of the participants was compared between the two conditions and to the performance models' predictions.

## Results
Both the models and the empirical evaluation found that the human-robot condition generally results in lower workload than the human-human condition. As well, the empirical results generally mirror the model results for each condition, with the human-robot peer-based team model slightly overestimating the measured workload. This research provides initial support for the applicability of a current workload HPMF (for human-only teams) to human-robot peer-based teams.

<!--
A model representing workload for each team was developed using IMPRINT Pro. The results from an empirical evaluation were compared to the model results. While significant differences between the two conditions were not found in all data, there was a general trend that workload in the human-robot condition was slightly lower than the workload experienced in the human-human condition. This trend was predicted by the IMPRINT Pro models. These results are the first to indicate that existing HPMFs can be applied to human-robot peer-based teams.
