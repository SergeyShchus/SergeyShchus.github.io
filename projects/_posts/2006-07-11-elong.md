Its main business is selling airline tickets, hotel reservations, and vacation packages at discounted price via the company website and telephone booking system.

## Method
We interviewed 20 frequent users of eLong.com, extracted their profiles, and then used a mixed apporach including quantitative cluster analysis and qualitative abstraction to create personas for design goal-setting and evaluation. We also designed new prototypes and recruited another 10 users to test the new design in terms of task flow and usability improvements.
